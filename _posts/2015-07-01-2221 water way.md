The house at 2221 Water Way is located along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, approximately one hour outside the center of Houston, TX. The house is based on a series of spatial strategies which are designed specifically to fit the clients’ lifestyle.

The ground floor is composed of a single living space combining kitchen and living area. In the center of this area is a double height space spanning from the ground all the way to the peak of the roof. This tall space is accentuated by a large natural fireplace made of exposed concrete block. An open loft on the second floor creates an informal gathering area that is visually connected to the living area below. The double-height space creates a separation between two guest rooms at the front and the large master suite in the rear.

On the other side of the house, an open garage and interior courtyard break up the house’s form, giving it an urban scale and creating a range of outdoor spaces to fit the tropical environment. These include a large covered patio in the rear, a ground-floor deck connected to a roof deck with direct connection to master suite, and a private balcony shared by the two guest rooms. The courtyard also creates an isolated dining room which is separate from the main living area but connected directly to the street through the garage.
