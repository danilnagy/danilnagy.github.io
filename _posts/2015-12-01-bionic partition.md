The Bionic Partition is a design concept for a new component for the Airbus A320 aircraft developed in collaboration with Airbus, Autodesk, and AP Works. The goal of the project was to redesign the interior partition component of the aircraft such that it performs equally well to the existing partition, but weighs 50% less. Weight reduction is a critical focus of the aircraft industry today, and will be the key to maintaining the environmental and economic sustainability of air travel into the future.

To achieve this difficult goal, the Bionic Partition leverages cutting-edge metal alloys developed at Airbus, new fabrication techniques in metal 3d printing, and new design software which can iterate through many design options, analyze each one for its performance, and ‘evolve’ better performing designs over time. By combining human intuition with artificial intelligence, this novel [generative design](https://medium.com/generative-design) workflow can create much better and higher performing designs that would be possible through a traditional design process. After three years of development, the project resulted in a complete, testable prototype of the world’s largest metal 3D printed airplane component. This prototype is currently undergoing 16G crash testing as part of the process for certification and integration into the current fleet of A320 planes.

The Bionic Partition was unveiled at the Autodesk University annual conference in Las Vegas in 2015. It has been covered in [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/2015/12/airbuss-newest-design-is-based-on-slime-mold-and-bones/) and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/manufacturers-take-a-page-from-mother-nature-1480420802), was a finalist in Fast Company’s 2016 [Innovation by Design Awards](https://www.fastcodesign.com/product/bionic-partition) and was the winner of a [2017 Architizer A+ Award](http://awards.architizer.com/winners-gallery/?type=51) for innovation in 3d printing.
