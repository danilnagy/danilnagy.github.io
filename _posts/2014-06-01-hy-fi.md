Temporary art installation

MoMA PS1<br>
Queens, NY

Completion: June, 2014

Commissioned by the MoMA PS1 museum as part of their annual 'Young Architects Competition', Hy-Fi offers a captivating physical environment and a new paradigm for sustainable architecture. In 2014, we tested and refined a new low-energy biological building material, manufactured 10,000 compostable bricks, constructed a 13-meter-tall tower, hosted public cultural events for three months, disassembled the structure, composted the bricks, and returned the resulting soil to local community gardens. This successful experiment offers many possibilities for future construction.
